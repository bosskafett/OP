Welcome to the unfinished OpenPenguins.

I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish this off by now, I kind of lost motivation as everyone does at a certain point.

Hopefully I've created enough to help you on your way to becoming a better Flash Game developer.

You can use this project in whatever way you want.

============
Edit language and server data in:
Include/configuration.as

Edit the client receive data model
Include/server_response.as

Information/ includes all the data that the game will use to apply to the classes.

Features:
Penguin Waddle
Penguin Clothes
Penguin Colours
Player-cards
Simple UI
Inventory
Chat
Actions
Emotes
Jokes
Mail Alerts

To be completed (at a later date):
Mail
Buddies
Igloos/Rooms
Games
Additional features such as Stamps.

Good at ActionScript? See if you can improve the project.
NOTE: this project has not been left mostly in-complete because I wasn't able to finish the remaining features due to a lack of knowledge, I have done all of the above before in a previous project that I never released. (Zingies)
============

============
Socket Server

A simple PHP socket was attached in this release, this may be modified to a different language.
============

Happy Coding,
